This project involves making a recommender system for big retail chains such as Walmart,Target to find the best locations to open their outlet.This is accomplished by getting the coordinates of different neighborhoods and the using the Foursquare API to get the venues information in that neighbourhood which helps the retail chains to identify the best potential customers and decide whether opening a store in that neighborhood would be profitable or not.
